This is a group project, so you will submit a 1 page peer review for each of your group mates. You will also write a 1 page self-reflection on how you think you did.

Your Project must be fully responsive and each member of the team must submit the entire project.

Person Review: Jose Martinez
Page: index.html background patter is not showing up. Only shows white background. Nav menu does not match color or text size from prototype
footer does not match prototype. Responsiveness looks good.

Page: About.html looks good on large size. on 1024X1200 Laptop L 1440px first image looks squished. Mobile view cards are to long. Iphone 12 Pro

Page: Catering.html background image patter not showing up. Its only white background. Missing footer, and missing responsiveness

Page Photo.html ..... ?????? no content at all. What is going on here? I am kind worried here on this one.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
